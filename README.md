## How to use:

2. execute SCTX.exe
3. start nginx webserver (run webserver/nginx.exe)

## Hint

Since sctx.exe makes use of sensible screen data to display in the app, it might get catched by an antivirus software.

(I tested this on my pc and it got catched and removed by Avast even though this test says it's clean)
If the .exe dissapears, check your antivirus quarantine.
